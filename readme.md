# @liquify/schema

This module contains [JSON Schema Stores](https://json-schema.org/) which are used by the [Liquify](https://liquify.dev) IDE extension. This package is available on the npm registry for modules consumed by the [Liquify](https://liquify.dev) text editor.

**The schema stores developed for the Shopify Liquid variation require that you ask permission before using. Unless you have consent, you cannot implement the structures into your projects without first consulting the project maintainer.**

### Why?

Liquify supports completions and validations for JSON files and embedded regions. Projects using the Liquify IDE tool require these stores to provide intellisense features.

# Usage

If you are using the Liquify extension ([vscode-liquid](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid)) these stores will be provided automatically. In cases where you require reference to the stores explicitly, then you can implement them using the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) CDN.

When referencing a schema, it is assumed that your text editor supports JSON `$schema` properties.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@liquify/schema/{store}"
}
```

> Replace the `{store}` portion with the appropriate Schema Store [below](#schema-stores).

### Internal Usage

Using the module within the workspace points `main` in the root package.json to the `/package` directory.
