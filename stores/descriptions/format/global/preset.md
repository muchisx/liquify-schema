#### Preset

The `preset` rule is a global option that will set a different **default** ruleset style guide. Using the `preset` rule will assign formatting rules from which Æsthetic will default. There are 4 different preset options.

#### Note

If this rule is `undefined` it will default to using `none` which is least obtrusive formatting style.

#### 👎 &nbsp;&nbsp; `none`

This is the default style guide ruleset. It is least obtrusive preset option.

#### 👍 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `recommended`

This style guide is typically suited for most cases, it sets Æsthetic to use the common rules.

#### 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `warrington`

Warrington style is a custom preset option is more refined than `recommended` and less rigid than `strict`. It is a great preset to use when working in teams.

#### 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `strict`

This is a strict rule preset and typically more suited for experienced developers who write clean and refined code. Definitely not for everybody.

#### 🤡 &nbsp;&nbsp; `shopify`

This preset will replicate the output you'd get using the Shopify Liquid Prettier Plugin.
