### Preset

A preset ruleset style guide to use. This will assign rules according to a set of defaults to produce a certain beautification result.

#### Note

_If this rule is `undefined` it will default to using `default` which is least obtrusive formatting style._

### Options

#### 👎 &nbsp;&nbsp; `default`

This is the **default** and the most unobtrusive. Formatting will use a preservationist based technique with this preset mode.

#### 👍 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `recommended`

This style guide is typically suited for most cases, it will apply a base set of rules aligned with the Æsthetic approach.

#### 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `warrington`

This style guide preset is best suited for developers and specifically teams working with Shopify themes. The preset was curated by the talented [David Warrington](https://ellodave.dev/).

#### 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; `strict`

This is a strict ruleset curated by the projects author [Panoply](https://github.com/panoply).

#### 🤡 &nbsp;&nbsp; `shopify`

Replicates the Prettier style of formatting. If you've used the Shopify Liquid Prettier Plugin and enjoy that beautification style using this preset will produce the same results.
