#### End Newline

Whether or not files should end with an empty newline.

#### Note

When this rule is undefined or omitted then the Text Editor settings will be used, in vscode that is `*.endWithNewline` where `*` is a language name.  If an `.editorconfig` file is found present in root, those rules will be applied in **precedence** over your Text Editor settings.
