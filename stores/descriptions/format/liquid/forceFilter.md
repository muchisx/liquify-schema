### Force Filter

Forces Liquid filter `|` expressions onto newlines when the number of filters contained on a tag exceeds the limit defined. By default, this rule uses a value of `0` which will result in Liquid filters being forced when the tag or output token containing them spans ¾ (or 75%) of defined global [`wrap`](https://æsthetic.dev/rules/global/wrap) limit.
