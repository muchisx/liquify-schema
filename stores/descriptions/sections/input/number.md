A setting of type `number` outputs a single number field. In addition to the [standard attributes](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#standard-attributes) of an input setting.

When accessing the value of a `number` type setting, data is returned as one of the following:

- A [number](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#number).
- [nil](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#nil), if nothing has been entered.
