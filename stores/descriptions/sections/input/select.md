A setting of type `select` outputs a drop-down selector field. In addition to the [standard attributes](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#standard-attributes) of an input setting.

When accessing the value of a `select` type setting, data is returned as a [string](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#string).

> **NOTE**
>
> If `default` is unspecified, then the first option is selected by default.
