A setting of type `range` outputs a range slider field. In addition to the [standard attributes](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#standard-attributes) of an input setting.

When accessing the value of a `range` type setting, data is returned as a [number](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#number).

> **CAUTION**
>
> The `default` attribute is required. The `min`, `max`, `step`, and `default` attributes can't be string values. Failing to adhere results in an error.
