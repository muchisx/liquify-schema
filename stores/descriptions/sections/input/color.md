A setting of type `color` outputs a color picker field. You can use these fields to capture a color selection for various theme elements, such as the body text color.

When accessing the value of a color type setting, data is returned as one of the following:

- A [color object](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/objects/color).
- `blank`, if no selection has been made.
