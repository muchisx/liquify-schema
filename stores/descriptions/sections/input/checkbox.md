A setting of type `checkbox` outputs a checkbox field. These fields can be used for toggling features on and off, such as whether to show an announcement bar.

When accessing the value of a `checkbox` type setting, data is returned as a [boolean](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#boolean).

> **NOTE**
>
> If `default` is unspecified, then the value is false by default.
