A setting of type `radio` outputs a radio option field. In addition to the [standard attributes](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#standard-attributes) of an input setting, `radio` type settings have a required options attribute that accepts an array of value and label definitions.

You can use these fields to capture a multi-option selection, such as the alignment of a header logo.

When accessing the value of a radio type setting, data is returned as a [string](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics/types#string).

> **NOTE**
>
> If `default` is unspecified, then the first option is selected by default.
