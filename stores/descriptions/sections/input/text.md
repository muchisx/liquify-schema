A setting of type `text` outputs a single-line text field. In addition to the [standard attributes](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings#standard-attributes) of an input setting.

When accessing the value of a `text` type setting, data is returned as one of the following:

- A [string](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics#types).
- An [empty object](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/basics#empty), if nothing has been entered.
