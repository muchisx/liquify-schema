The `role` field outputs a color scheme preview. The color scheme previews are visible to merchants anywhere in the editor where they might pick a color scheme. You can assign roles to your color scheme definitions to map the color scheme to the previews. For example you can assign `role.background` to the `Background` definition. Role uses the following standardized mapping of the `color_scheme_group` definition to the color scheme preview.
