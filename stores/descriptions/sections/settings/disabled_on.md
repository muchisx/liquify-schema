You can prevent a section from being used on certain template page types and section group types by setting them in the `disabled_on` attribute. When you use `disabled_on`, the section is available to all templates and section groups except the ones that you specified.

`disabled_on`, along with `enabled_on`, replaces the `templates` attribute.

> **CAUTION**
>
> You can use only one of [`disabled_on`](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#disabled_on). or `disabled_on`
