You can restrict a section to certain template page types and section group types by specifying them through the `enabled_on` attribute.

`enabled_on`, along with `disabled_on`, replaces the templates attribute.

> **CAUTION**
>
> You can use only one of `enabled_on` or [`disabled_on`](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#disabled_on).
