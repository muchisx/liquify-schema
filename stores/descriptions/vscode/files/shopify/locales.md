**Default** `""`

Provide the path location to the default locale (ie: `en.default.json`) file. Use a path that is relative to the current project root directory. When you provide a locale file path reference then completions will show for locales in output type object tags.

**IMPORTANT**

You must point to path to **default** language file.
