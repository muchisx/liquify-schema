**Default** `shopify`

The `liquid.engine` option is used to determine the Liquid template variation you are working with. This extension supports the following Liquid variations:

- Standard
- Shopify
- 11ty
- Jekyll

Features and capabilities differ depending on the engine you define. For example, if you are working with the Shopify Liquid variation and you have set the engine to `Standard` then features like object and property completions will not work.

**Tip**

You can optionally infer the engine with your `.liquidrc` file.
