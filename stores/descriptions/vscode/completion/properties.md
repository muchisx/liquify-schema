**Default** `true`

💁🏽‍♀️ &nbsp;&nbsp; Recommended setting is `true`

Whether or not to enable Liquid property completions for known objects. This option requires the Liquid `engine` to be set to `shopify`. When enabled (ie: `true`)  properties of known objects are triggered when typing `.` and the previous keyword is a determined to be known object reference.

**Note**

This option will only trigger properties, but not objects. You need to enable `liquid.completion.objects` for object completions.
