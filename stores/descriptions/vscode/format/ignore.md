**Default** `[]`

A glob pattern list of file's and/or directories to be ignored from formatting. Use relative paths to exclude or ignore beautification running on certain files or uri path locations within your workspace.

**Tip**

You can also leverage inline ignore comments. Place a Prettify ignore comment at the top of files you wish to exclude from beautification, for example:

```html

<!-- @prettify-ignore -->

```
