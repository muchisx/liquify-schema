**Default** `true`

💁🏽‍♀️ &nbsp;&nbsp; Recommended setting is: `true`

Whether to enable or disable beautification support for Liquid. The setting takes precedence over `editor.defaultFormatter` defined configurations, so if disabled (ie: `false`) formatting will not be applied. This extension uses [Prettify](https://github.com/panoply/prettify) for formatting and supports the following languages:

- Liquid
- HTML
- XML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JSON
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

#### 🎀 Prettify

Prettify is a _new generation_ beautification tool that runs atop of the powerful sparser lexing algorithm. Prettify can be used as an alternative to Prettier and has been developed for usage with Liquid. It's fast, exposes a granular set of rules and is far from opinionated.
